## Poject to use scikit learn to predict a classification problem using KNeighbors and LogisticRegression
leaned how to use train test split

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# save "bunch" object containing iris dataset and its attributes

# store feature matrix in "X"

# store response vector in "y"

## we trained and test on same data and saw how accurate, then we did train test split and saw how accurate model
