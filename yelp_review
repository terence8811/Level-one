# my first assignment i speghetti some code together, made me learn about the sequentialness of the cells in jupyter notebook, how to
fix some errors real quick, how to alter code to fit my project, didn't quiet understand responce that my machine was calculation, prob
had to do with yelp stars and how to predict them in the future based by what people write in text

data.stars.value_counts().sort_index()
# cool thing taught me how to use both classes
